[CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) is a beginner-friendly website for anyone to be able to learn the foundations of cryptography in an interactive way. It provides a wide variety of "Capture-the-Flag" style cryptography puzzles to help you learn and practice. In my opinion, it does a great job of throwing you in the deep end and gets you to learn by actually hacking, as opposed to being too in the trenches with theory. I'd recommend people who are interested to try out the courses/challenges. My profile on CryptoHack is [here](https://cryptohack.org/user/IzaacMammadov/).
