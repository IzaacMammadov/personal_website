Following on from [last year](/aoc_2023), I took part again in this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding challenges. I would recommend everybody give them a go. I was less consistent about waking up on time to do them when they come out, but for the first time got to end and achieved all 50 stars. My GitHub repo of solutons can be found [here](https://github.com/IzaacMammadov/AOC-2024) and my personal times are below:
