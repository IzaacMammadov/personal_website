## About me
My name is Izaac Mammadov and I'm 23 years old. I live in London, UK and this website is me yearning for the old internet that I'm too young to have experienced.

I studied [BA Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tripos) at [Corpus Christi College](https://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/) in the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I focused on Probability and Statistics (''applicable'') courses and ended up graduating 18th in the year. I worked at [Wintermute](https://wintermute.com/) as an Algorithmic Trader for 1.5 years trading cryptocurrencies and their derivatives across centralised exchanges. I currently am a Quantitative Researcher at [The Quarry](https://www.quarrylp.com/), focusing on medium-frequency Equity Volatility trading strategies.
