## About me
My name is Izaac Mammadov and I'm 23 years old. I live in London, UK and this website is me yearning for the old internet that I'm too young to have experienced.

I studied [BA Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tripos) at [Corpus Christi College](https://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/) in the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I focused on Probability and Statistics (''applicable'') courses and ended up graduating 18th in the year. I worked at [Wintermute](https://wintermute.com/) as an Algorithmic Trader for 1.5 years trading cryptocurrencies and their derivatives across centralised exchanges. I currently am a Quantitative Researcher at [The Quarry](https://www.quarrylp.com/), focusing on medium-frequency Equity Volatility trading stratgies.

Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/izaac-mammadov/), my [GitHub](https://github.com/IzaacMammadov), my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/StayWoke) and my [CV](CV.pdf) if you're interested. My [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net) friend code is: 2025883\_edkACzu3F1JSHsKGh85ME1MC2ap6cTzY, and my Urbit @p is: ~diblud-ricbet.
