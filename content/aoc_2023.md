The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an annual programming competition that takes place in the run-up to Christmas (between 1st December and 25th Decemeber), run by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The challenges start off pretty easy (do-able by anyone who knows the basics of any programming langauge) but scale up in difficulty quickly. There is a leaderboard for the quickest time to solve problems globally (which has some insanely fast times), but I think the most fun is had as part of a private leaderboard between your friends. Unfortunately for those based in Europe, the problems are released at 5am UTC every day.

I took part last year and got up to Day 22 before I had to give up. I decided to stop the first time I didn't/couldn't solve a problem on the day that it was released. Here are my times on the days that I woke up at 5am to do the problem:

Also if you're interested to see my solutions to the problems, then they're available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/IzaacMammadov/AOC-2023). I found that a lot of time could be saved by pre-coding simple functions to do most of the pre-processing for me. That's probably what I'll work on before this year's set of problems. I encourage everyone who knows how to code to take part this year (in circa 10 months)!
