<p>The <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of Code</a> is an annual programming competition that takes place in the run-up to Christmas (between 1st December and 25th Decemeber), run by <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. The challenges start off pretty easy (do-able by anyone who knows the basics of any programming langauge) but scale up in difficulty quickly. There is a leaderboard for the quickest time to solve problems globally (which has some insanely fast times), but I think the most fun is had as part of a private leaderboard between your friends. Unfortunately for those based in Europe, the problems are released at 5am UTC every day.</p>
<p>I took part last year and got up to Day 22 before I had to give up. I decided to stop the first time I didn&rsquo;t/couldn&rsquo;t solve a problem on the day that it was released. Here are my times on the days that I woke up at 5am to do the problem:</p>

</code></pre><p>Also if you&rsquo;re interested to see my solutions to the problems, then they&rsquo;re available <a href="https://github.com/IzaacMammadov/AOC-2023">here on GitHub</a>. I found that a lot of time could be saved by pre-coding simple functions to do most of the pre-processing for me. That&rsquo;s probably what I&rsquo;ll work on before this year&rsquo;s set of problems. I encourage everyone who knows how to code to take part this year (in circa 10 months)!</p>
